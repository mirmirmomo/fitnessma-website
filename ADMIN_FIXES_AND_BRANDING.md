## 🔧 Admin Dashboard Fixes

### 1. User Management (FIXED)
**Issue**: Block/Unblock user functionality was broken
- ❌ **Before**: Used wrong API endpoint `/api/admin/users/:id/block` with `is_blocked` field
- ✅ **After**: Uses correct endpoint `/api/admin/users/:id/status` with `status` field

**Fixed Functions**:
- `handleBlockUser()` - Now properly blocks/unblocks users
- User status display - Shows correct "Active"/"Blocked" status
- User statistics - Counts blocked users correctly

### 2. Coach Management (WORKING)
**All coach management features are functional**:
- ✅ Create new coaches with full details
- ✅ Edit existing coach information (specialty, rates, availability)
- ✅ Delete coaches (with safety checks for active appointments)
- ✅ View all coaches in organized table format

### 3. User Creation (WORKING)
**Admin can create new users**:
- ✅ Create clients, coaches, or admin users
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ Email uniqueness checking
- ✅ Password hashing

### 4. Appointment Management (WORKING)
**View and manage all appointments**:
- ✅ View all system appointments
- ✅ See client and coach details
- ✅ Filter by appointment status
- ✅ Appointment statistics

## 🌟 Enhanced UI/UX

### Navigation Bar
- **New Logo**: Gradient icon + FitnessMA branding
- **Improved Styling**: Better spacing, colors, and user avatar
- **Morocco Theme**: Professional fitness aesthetic

### Home Page
- **Hero Section**: Morocco-inspired fitness branding
- **Feature Cards**: Gradient icons and improved copy
- **Statistics**: Updated numbers and professional styling  
- **Services Section**: Added detailed fitness programs

### Admin Dashboard

## 🛠️ Technical Improvements

### API Endpoints (All Working)
```
GET    /api/admin/users          - Fetch all users
POST   /api/admin/users          - Create new user
PATCH  /api/admin/users/:id/status - Block/unblock user
DELETE /api/admin/users/:id      - Delete user

GET    /api/admin/coaches        - Fetch all coaches
POST   /api/admin/coaches        - Create new coach

DELETE /api/admin/coaches/:id    - Delete coach

GET    /api/admin/appointments   - Fetch all appointments
```

### Database Schema (Aligned)
- Users table uses `status` field ('active', 'blocked', 'inactive')
- Frontend now correctly maps to backend fields
- Proper relationships between users, coaches, and appointments

### Error Handling
- ✅ Form validation with clear error messages
- ✅ API error handling with user-friendly alerts
- ✅ Loading states and disabled buttons during operations
